## .Net Stock Indicator Library

This is a stock indicator library that is completely open source and I have written code for over 700 indicators. For my alpha version I published around 15 indicators with many more to be released in the next few weeks. 

### How to use this library

Calculate an indicator of your choice or go crazy and create an indicator of an indicator of an indicator. I have created this library will full customization in mind so feel free to change any settings, change the moving average used for different indicators, or come up with a crazy combo like getting the RSI of a MACD and wrap that up in a Bollinger Band of the result. Here is an easy example to get you started (Using the C# Alpaca Nuget package)
